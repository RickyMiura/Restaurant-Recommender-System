# Overview

This project focuses on building a restaurant recommender system using Google reviews by combining a popularity model and a similarity model. The system predicts whether a user is likely to visit a particular restaurant based on their review history and the restaurant's overall popularity.

## Key Highlights:
- **Data**: Filtered Google Maps review data for restaurants, including user ratings and restaurant metadata.
- **Model**: 
  - **Similarity Model**: Used **Jaccard similarity** to recommend restaurants based on user history.
  - **Popularity Model**: Incorporated restaurant popularity (measured by review counts) to improve recommendations for new users or less-reviewed restaurants.
- **Performance**: Achieved an AUC of 0.75 and an accuracy of 0.79, demonstrating robust predictive capability.

This project highlights how combining popularity and similarity-based approaches can create effective and scalable recommender systems for personalized restaurant suggestions.
